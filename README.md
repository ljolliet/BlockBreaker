# ProgMobile
This project is the first mobile app I ever developed. We had to create this cascade game, with score management and saves. I tried to do a bit of app design because the original graphics were not looking really good. 

A major part of the project was the algorithm behind the block fall after click. I used a recursive pattern to treat this problem. The algorithm is not optimised because I had several deadline at the same time. The saving management was also quite difficult to overcome because the way I used is not really intuitive, so I made several mistakes before a success.
